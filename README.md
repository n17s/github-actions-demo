# Overview
Create a docker image with tools using GitHub Actions

# How
- Make sure you have `docker` and [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) installed.
- We have tested things with [act version 0.2.70](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/tag/v0.2.70) 
- `git clone` this repo and cd to it
- Run `act --reuse`
- Run `bash save_image.sh`
